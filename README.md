# Unreal Engine 4.x Cookbook

Why This Repository?

I tend to add interesting things - code snippets and BP snapshots - into Evernote or inside of selected projects, but they are locked away from everyone else. I may have found a method of doing something that isn't covered in resources I've found, or I want to document it, so I want a common location to store that code for reuse and sharing. So here we are.

I find that a lot of tutorials only go "so far" in what they cover, and a number of more advanced subjects are missing, even in so-called "Advanced" tutorials, videos, and books.  These also tend to be a snapshot in time, and not a living document, so they age rather quickly.

As someone that has written a technical book for a major publishing house, I know how thankless that can be, and how quicky things age. I'd rather put the information out there for others, and also invite others to participate if they'd like. Open Source.

I'm a fan and a bit nostalgic for the days when you could buy a circuit "Cookbook" at Radio Shack and use it to build all sorts of interesting electronic projects. It was a kit of parts, and was endlessly fascinating. 

I don't claim any piece of code is earth-shattering or unique, but you may find it helpful in your work, and you can even contribute if you'd like. This is as much as sandbox for playing with UE as it is a cookbook.
